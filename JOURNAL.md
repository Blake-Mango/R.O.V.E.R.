## 10/19/2025 - started to look at how to use google API's  

Started exploring Google APIs for speech-to-text and text-to-speech. Working on sending audio input to the API, converting it to text, and using that text to get AI responses. Then I’m using text-to-speech to play the responses back. Still testing different settings for accuracy and voice quality, but it’s starting to work smoothly. just wanting to see if i can get a call and response from the ai before i start work on printing a few parts before i can get funding. ![download.jpg](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzY3NywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--5f2dfdf96d0b7c677d1aa04382fc03775e2d98f8/download.jpg)
